Welcome to the first official post for my newly revamped personal site running off the awesome Nuxt framework [https://nuxtjs.org].
If you're not familiar with Nuxt, here is a quick summary straight from the official site. 
Nuxt.js is summarized:

> Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.

>Its main scope is UI rendering while abstracting away the client/server distribution.

>Our goal is to create a framework flexible enough so that you can use it as a main project base or in addition to your current project based on Node.js.
In this post I'll review the following:


#### Introduction


I decided that it was time to move away from WordPress and adopt static blogging when [https://vuejs.org]
came out. Oddly enough I made this decision around the time that Nuxt was formalizing as a framework
for building Universal apps, but I never really gave the docs a read till recently. 

I was looking at using Vuejs directly to build my Vue news site [http://vuejsradar.com] and building
my own layers, investigating SSR. All of this was posted in my first two posts on the site. Fortunately, I read into 
Nuxt in more detail and realized it could handle a lot of the features I wanted straight out of the box. 

While there has been static blogging tools like Jekyll for a while, I really like the idea of using Nuxt because it's already
part of a the Javascript / VueJS eco system which I understand already. Using gems and Ruby is fairly foreign and
is not something I'm interested in adding to my already full plate of "Full Stack" skills.

To meet the most basic needs of my personal site, I really only wanted 3 things to get going:

- Standalone files to store my site blog posts (ideally in Markdown and/or HTML)
- Meta data stored in an array (vuex)
- slug / pretty urls mapped to content

Fortunately, doing all of this was pretty easy. The remainder of this post is going to review how I setup my personal
site. Eventually I will be updating the the repository I setup [https://github.com/andreliem/vuecms] to reflect the new
direction of basing everythig off of Nuxt.

### Getting Setup
Getting setup with Nuxt was as painless as getting setup with Vue JS using the CLI.  

```
vue init nuxt/starter <project-name>

```

```
cd <project-name>
$ npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

From here you can author components as you would normally to represent content on
your site. With this basic setup you could blog by creating one Vue file per post.

But what I wanted was a more streamlined approach which only relies on one single Vue file to render to posts
and pulls in data from a `Vuex` store.


#### Slug Style Blog Posts 
WordPress popularized the pretty url format (slugs) for blog posts and is pretty important to have for SEO purposes.
Doing this with Nuxt involves the following:

``` 
mkdir pages/_slug 
touch pages/_slug/index.vue
```

That's more or less it! You create a directory with an `_` prefix and then Nuxt automagically
maps the routes for you.

e.g. - `/i-am-a-slug` can be accessed in a computed property in `index.vue` as 
```
this.$route.params.slug
```

#### Vuex for representing meta data
Nuxt provides great support for Vuex, but there's a slight difference in how you need to define your state.

```
export const state = () => ({
  list: [
    {
      id: 1,
      slug: 'hello-nuxt-markdown',
      title: 'Welcome to my new site using Nuxt + MarkDown',
      created_at: '10/22/2016'
    }
  ]
})
```

Notice how we are returning a function, it's a minor change but is needed for Vuex with Nuxt. In this above example, I have defined a basic array of JSON data to represent each post.  

#### Loading the Post from Vuex

To fetch the data from the store, I use a computed property which uses the `$route` object to get the `slug` value. 
Nuxt creates the routes for you so there's no work for you to do.

```
let post = this.$store.state.posts.list.find((post) => {
  return (post.slug === this.$route.params.slug)
})
```

#### Mark Down Loading + Parsing

I decided that Markdown would be my goto format for blog posts. Some day I might try to support others, like
straight up HTML+JS Inline, but for now Markdown is a great solution that is pretty standard for static blogging.

To accomplish this, two packages are required:

```
npm install marked --save
npm install vue-markdown --save
```

`marked` as it name suggests handles mark down files. This library will turn marked down content into HTML which 
you can output easily using the `v-html` directive.

`vue-markdown` is a file loader that you'll need to include the markdown file dynamically.

### Code Highlighting

Something that is really important for any developer blogging is having `<pre>` code with some syntax highlighting.
A great library for this is `highlight.js`. 

```
npm install highlight.js --save

```

The trickier part is figuring out how to integrate this into the project.

It's probably best if I put this all together in one code sample below. 


`_slug/index.vue`
``` 
<template>
  <div class="post">
    <div v-html="postContent"></div>
  </div>
</template>
<script type="text/babel">
  import marked from 'marked'
  export default {
    layout: 'slug',
    computed: {
      postContent () {
        let post = this.$store.state.posts.list.find((post) => {
          return (post.slug === this.$route.params.slug)
        })
        if (!post) {
          return
        }
        marked.setOptions({
          highlight: function (code) {
            return require('highlight.js').highlightAuto(code).value
          }
        })
        return marked(require('../../content/posts/${post.id}.md'))
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

This file does the following in one `computed` function.

1. Find the post given the slug in the URL
2. Return if it does not exist
3. Integrate code syntax highlighting with `highlight.js`
4. Load a local markdown MD file using the `id` of the post as a unique file identifier.

That's it! With this single file and some basic CSS integrations (I picked bootstrap) you have a basic blog:

1. Create new entry in the Vuex state to represent the post.
2. Create the markdown file and type away.

### Deploying + Going Live

Once you are ready to go live, you can either deploy as a Server Rendered site (SSR) or Static. I'm interested
in deploying a static site, so the command to run is

```
npm run generate
```

This crates a `dist` folder that you can upload to your hosting service. I won't go over the tools you can use here
as there are some pretty neat solutions for hosting static sites... perhaps in another post. For now, all I'm doing
is hacking it through a github commit process. I'll look at improving that in the future but for now it serves my 
needs.

#### Conclusion 

There are a few more details that you will need to handle to have this all going exactly as I have it on my site,
such as layouts, css imports... I'll have this all posted up as a ready to use Nuxt
blog in the github repo [https://github.com/andreliem/vuecms]
