My personal website using the NUXT framework. 

Feel free to use for your own personal site but be
warned that this is very experimental right now.

Provides the following:
- slug based blog posts
- markdown
- syntax highlighting (buggy)
- vuex + without any API 

## Build Setup (nuxt)

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
